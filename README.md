# python-api-challenge
I accidentally ran the initial city_data_df again after plotting the subsequent graphs and maps, so the cities generated in WeatherPy may look different to those visualised later on!
I couldn't get the "locale" : "en" parameter to return English-only hotel names. I can only assume this is because there were no equivalent English names in the database. 
Geoapify documentation seemed to specify the bias param I used as the only one available.
I also added in the units = "metric" variable to the second for loop, because it looked as though this was what was required, based on the pre-set output. 
It was hard to determine whether I should adapt your code or not.
Overall, I found this assignment fun but fiddly!
